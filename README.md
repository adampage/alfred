Enter the keyword "rubberbanding" into Alfred to toggle Mac OS X's native rubber
band (i.e., elastic) scrolling on or off.  After entering the keyword, a dialog
will appear showing you the current state of elastic scrolling.  To toggle that
state, simply press the dialog's confirm button, or cancel to leave the setting
unchanged.
